##  AUTOMATED DATA PROFILING USING AI TECHNIQUES WITH ML
Data profiling, the methodical process of identifying and documenting the properties of data sets, is becoming more and more important as the market for artificial intelligence expands. 
Dataprofiling can help you find potential knowledge opportunities and evaluate how well your data is being maintained if you want to improve the quality of your data

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Automated data profiling tools can collect and analyse data from multiple sources, and provide insights into the quality, accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data. Automated data profiling tools can perform tasks such as identifying data types, detecting data anomalies, determining data patterns, and identifying data relationships. As well as providing the training data that is needed to train models, when using Auto ML you can specify what type of model validation to perform. This model validation takes place during training, when automated ML uses validation data to tune model hyperparameters based on the applied algorithm to find the combination that best fits the training data. The same validation data is used for each iteration of tuning, which introduces model evaluation bias since the model continues to improve and fit to the validation data . After the validation then we will get the report for the data. Then we can come to know that which model is more efficient then that will give the best data profiling.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->

Auto ML presents a powerful tool for automated data profiling, offering significant benefits in terms of speed, accuracy, and scalability,F1 score. By seeing these we get the best model among all other models .From these we get the better report of the data. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in data profiling is a great process that can increase the knowledge of an organization. This includes identifying data that is archived and is either wrong or missing or contains conflicting information or identifying data as belonging to a particular category such as the customer data content category, product data content category, or the transaction data content category. It groups the related data together, as well as presents the relationship between various characteristics of the data that was input to the machine learning algorithms. Therefore, data profiling for an organization would involve employing AI and machine learning to enhance data utilization and derive its value in the contemporary world economy.
